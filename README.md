Open source code for the Museum of Mechanics: Lockpicking

Hi! This is the Unity project for the Itch.io version of The Museum of Mechanics: Lockpicking (https://dimbulbgames.itch.io/museum-of-mechanics-lockpicking). 

The Museum of Mechanics: Lockpicking is a browsable, playable collection of lockpicking mechanics from various games. The intended audience is game developers looking to explore the range of lockpicking mechanics that have been implemented in the past.

This diverges from the published version in only one important way: it does not include code or content that I do not have permissions to distribute, including InControl for input, and all of the 3d assets. Instead, the Unity project here will make a 2d application that lets you browse the games on offer through a menu. All of the code for the games is included.

My hope is that this collection of code will be useful for anyone wanting to implement lockpicking minigames in their work, or for people hoping to learn about game development in Unity. I also would love to see bug fixes, new games, and anything else to improve the collection for the community.
